This is the game, INVASION, made by Jinsong Han.

This game plays similarily to Galaga, as it involves the player ship trying to shoot down all the enemy ships while dodging enemy bullets. There are a variety of enemy types, including those that fire super fast bullets and homing shots.

In order to make the game easier for the player, the player has health. This can be seen by the judgement line around the player, which ranges from Blue to Green to Yellow to Orange to Red. If you are hit while red, it's game over. You can press START to then retry from the stage where you died with full HP.

There are also powerups - but some of which actually harm you.

There is also a slow-down feature that can be activated by holding R or L (heavy slow-down). This slows everything in-game to give you more reaction time. However, this resource is time-limited, so don't rely on it too much!

Press A on the title screen to see more information.

Have fun!
